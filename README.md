# Goal

Implement the feature before the end of the timer :

> We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an update to our system:

> “Conjured” items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items

And prove that the functionality is well implemented

Bonus :

+ Find and Fix the hidden bug 🔥🐛🔥 :)
+ Leave the code in a cleaner state (the cleaner the better)
+ Use tests

Double bonus : **TDD**
